\caption{R00\_SW1 image showing phosphorescence (top) with morphology similar to the ``coffee stains'' (bottom) observed with {\it blue} CCOB LED illumination. The phosphorescence acquired in dark exposures within the first 15\,s following trigger (top) uses a logarithmic stretch with limits 5--25 e$^-$/pixel. The {\it blue} flat field (bottom) is displayed normalized, with 4\% stretch limits (0.97 to 1.01), for a target signal level of $10^4$ e$^-$/pixel. Note that the phosphorescence pattern resembles the dark wisps in the flat (with opposite polarity) but that there are apparently no significant phosphorescence features corresponding to the bright wisps.}
