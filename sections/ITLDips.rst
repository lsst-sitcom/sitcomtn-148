ITL Dips
###########

One of the phenomenon that was stuided in the later part of Run 7 was ITL dips. 
These were first discovered in LSST ComCam with on-sky data as bleed trails from bright stars that traversed the entire detector, jumping over the amplifier boundaries. 
These bleed trails are unique though in that the core of the bleed trail is actually 'dark' compared to the wings of the bleed trail, with a lower flux of around 2% compared to the rest of the bleed trail.

We tried to investigate if there were any ITL dips in the sensors of LSSTCam. 
For this study, we used spots and rectangles created by a 4K projector onto the focal plane. 
The spots were roughly 30 pixels across and were in every amplifier of each detector. 
The rectangles were only in the top right amplifier (C10). 
One unique feature with this spot projection was that there was a background illumination caused by the projector. 
This led to the spots having a signal only 6 times higher than the background and the rectangles with a signal 30 times higher than the background. 

Investigating these images, we were not able to find any evidence of ITL dips. 
Below are the images themselves along with binned horizontal cutouts of the the amplifier below the source. 
These show the background pattern of the projector, but no 2% dip.

While we were not able to find evidence of the ITL dip in Run 7 data, it is still not clear if this will not be visible in LSSTCam on-sky data. 
The photon rate of the in-lab data was roughly XXX per second for the 15 second exposures. 
The stars that were seen in ComCam with the ITL dip have a magnitude of XXX corresponding to a photon rate of XXX. 
This is combined with a sky background of XXX as compared with the lab sensor background of XXX.
