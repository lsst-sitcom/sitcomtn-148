Bias stability
############################################
Bias instabilities are of 2 kinds :
1) ITL bias jumps
2) e2v 2D shapes.
   
Both observed in Run 6 and deeply studied. Issue 1 considered as hardware-level issue, tried to mitigate issue 2 by acquisition optimization in Run 7.

For the baseline configuration (see conclusion), three stability runs were recorded :
1) Run E2136 : 15-s darks with long delays
2) Run E2236 : 50 15-s darks, 50 biases
3) Run E2330 : 15-s and 30-s darks with delays

Plots:
1) Examples : 1 stable CCD / 1 instable CCD
2) Instable CCD : comparison of the 3 runs
3) Some yellow corner images (bias, 15-s exposure, 30-s exposure)
4) Mosaic of stability metric
