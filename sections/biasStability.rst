Bias stability
############################################
Bias instabilities are of 2 kinds :

#. ITL bias jumps
#. e2v 2D shapes.
   
Both observed in Run 6 and deeply studied. Issue 1 considered as hardware-level issue, tried to mitigate issue 2 by acquisition optimization in Run 7.

For the baseline configuration (see conclusion), three stability runs were recorded :

#. Run E2136 : 15-s darks with long delays
#. Run E2236 : 50 15-s darks, 50 biases
#. Run E2330 : 15-s and 30-s darks with delays

eo_pipe bias stability task : bias +  serial overscan correction, mean of the image

Plots:
	    
#. Examples : 1 stable CCD / 1 instable CCD
#. Instable CCD : comparison of the 3 runs
#. Some yellow corner images (bias, 15-s exposure, 30-s exposure)
#. Mosaic of stability metric
