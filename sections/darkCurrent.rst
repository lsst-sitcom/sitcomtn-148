Dark current and light leaks
############################################

This section describes dark current and light leaks in Run 7 testing.

One of the first tests we attempted with the camera was measuring dark current and sources of light leaks in the camera body.

Light leak mitigation with shrouding the camera body
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Sources of light leak with the autochanger

After completing the shroud of the camera, we proceeded with several long dark exposures using different filter and shutter conditions to establish our baseline dark condition for testing. 

- We acquired 900s darks with different shutter conditions and the empty frame filter in place.
- We acquired 900s darks in different filters with the shutter open
