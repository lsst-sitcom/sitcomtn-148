\section{Reference figures}

\subsection{From Sections \ref{sec:reverification} and \ref{sec:finalCharacterization}}
\subsubsection{Focal-plane measurement figures}

One of two common plots from Sections \ref{sec:reverification} and \ref{sec:finalCharacterization} is a focal-plane measurement plot, showing eo-pipe measurements in different runs. These plots are constructed to show measurements arranged localized to the LSSTCam focal plane orientation. Different sensors are plotted in different colors, with one point plotted for each amplifier on each sensor. The plots are arranged such that an apples-to-apples comparison is made between two different runs (see figure \ref{fig:ref:eoPipeFP_5x5}). On one axis is the measurements from one run, while the other axis has the measurements from a different run. If the measurements are consistent, the points should fall along the identity line. Deviations from measurements on the identity line indicate that one run is measuring the quantity at a higher or lower value than the other run. This plot is useful for identifying localized deviations between different runs, and also e2v and ITL specific behavior.

    \label{fig:ref:eoPipeFP_5x5}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Differential histograms}

Another common plot from Sections \ref{sec:reverification} and \ref{sec:finalCharacterization} is a histogram, where the counts in histogram bins are differences of amplifier measurements for a given quantity. These histograms are commonly separated by detector type, to show any type-dependent differences. In the case of no significant differences, these histograms should be Gaussians centered around zero, with no biases in one direction or another. %Distributions that are not centered around zero indicate a change in the measurement between different runs.

\subsection{Web report reference figures}

A tool for rapidly reviewing LSSTCam EO data is the \href{https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/data/rubin/lsstcam/}{web reports}, which provide full focal plane, raft-level, and sensor-level figures of reference for prompt interpretation of analyses. Web reports from Runs 6 and 7 are available.

\subsubsection{Focal plane level}
% \paragraph{Focal-plane layout}

\paragraph{Focal plane mosaics for different quantities}

Focal plane mosaics represent amplifier-level EO test quantities arrayed asfully assembled focal planes, with amplifiers colored according to the associated measurement. The full focal plane mosaics are generated for most eo-pipe parameters.
%and are scaled appropriately for each parameter. 
These visualizations show differences between e2v and ITL sensor performance across the focal plane, as well as variations on the sensor and amplifier levels (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:fpMosaic}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/ptc_gain_plot_LSSTCam_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{A focal plane mosaic from run E1881 for PTC gain.}
    \label{fig:ref:fpMosaic}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Histograms}

In addition to focal-plane mosaics, histograms are created for all eo-pipe metrics. These histograms have bin widths and ranges specific to each parameter. For some parameters, the histograms provide convenient visualizationsto quantify differences between e2v and ITL performance, such as Figure~\ref{fig:ref:histogram} for PTC $a_{00}$. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/ptc_a00_hist_LSSTCam_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{A histogram from run E1881 for PTC $a_{00}$}
    \label{fig:ref:histogram}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Raft level}

\paragraph{Correlation figures}

Correlation figures are created on the raft level for all science rafts. Two types of correlation figures are created; one for the imaging region, and one for the overscan region. The correlation computed is a Pearson correlation coefficient (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:overscanCorrelations}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/overscan_correlation_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_raft_amp_correlations_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T015955Z.png}
    \caption{Overscan correlations for R22\_S11 in run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:overscanCorrelations}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Lambda mosaics}

As a part of the standard B protocol acquisitions, flats are taken in different LEDs to provide a chromatic response across the LSST bandpass. The mosaic is assembled on the raft level, and short-wavelength flats show the laser annealing pattern characteristic to e2v sensors (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:blueLambda}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/eoRaftMosaic_LSSTCam_blue_MC_C_20241030_000276_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_raft_lambda_mosaics_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020341Z.png}
    \caption{Blue LED mosaic for R22 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:blueLambda}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Calibration frames}

For runs with bias dark and flat frame acquisitions (most commonly B protocols), combined calibration bias and dark frames are produced and assembled on the raft level. These mosaics are gain corrected (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:calibFrame} for an example of a calibration dark).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/eoDarkRaftMosaic_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_raft_calib_mosaics_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020324Z.png}
    \caption{Calibration dark for R22 from run E1880, extracted using B protocol dark sequence.}
    \label{fig:ref:calibFrame}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Bias stability}

Bias stability figures are created for acquisition sequences that acquire multiple bias frames. Three different bias stability plots are created: amplifier-wise mean vs. time, amplifier-wise standard deviation vs. time, amplfier-wise mean vs. time for a region covering the readout corner.  An example of the latter is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ref:biasStability}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/bias_rc_mean_vs_time_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_bias_stability_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020021Z.png}
    \caption{Bias stability mean vs. time for readout corners of the amplifiers organized by sensor in R22, from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:biasStability}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\paragraph{Divisadero profiles}

Divisadero tearing profiles are created for each raft, with divisadero response grouped along the mid-line break. Dashed lines indicate regions where divisadero effects on the response are expected (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:divisaderoProfile}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/divisadero_raft_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_divisadero_tearing_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020421Z.png}
    \caption{Divisadero tearing profile for R22 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:divisaderoProfile}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Sensor level}

\paragraph{Bias profiles}

Bias profile plots are created for each sensor, along both serial and parallel directions. Amplifiers are plotted separately to allow amplifier-dependent response to be identified. Different columns/rows are plotted in different colors for identification of problematic columns/rows (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:biasProfile}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/bias_parallel_profile_plots_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_bias_stability_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020021Z.png}
    \caption{Median bias profile in the parallel direction for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:biasProfile}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{PTCs}

PTC plots are created for each sensor, and separated by amplifier. For each amplifier, a PTC curve is created. PTC gain, $a_{00}$, and PTC turnoff (in ADU) is shown for each amplifier. The red points in PTC curves (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:PTCs}) denote all measurements before PTC turnoff.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/ptc_plots_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{PTC plots for R22\_S11 from run E1881.}
    \label{fig:ref:PTCs}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\paragraph{Nonlinearity}

Linearity plots are created for each sensor, and separated by amplifier. For each amplifier, a linearity curve is created showing photodiode current integral vs. e-/pixel for all flat pairs. Maximum fractional deviation, maximum observed signal, and linearity turnoff (in ADU) are shown for each amplifier. The red points in the linearity curves (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:linearity}) denote all measurements between 100 e-/pixel and linearity turnoff.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/linearity_fit_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_linearity_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131453Z.png}
    \caption{Linearity plots for R22\_S11 from run E1881.}
    \label{fig:ref:linearity}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
Plots of linearity residuals are also generated, showing the fractional residuals for each amplifier as a function of the photodiode current integral (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:linearityResids}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/linearity_residuals_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_linearity_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131453Z.png}
    \caption{Linearity residual plots for R22\_S11 from run E1881.}
    \label{fig:ref:linearityResids}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Data from flat pairs}

For studies of row-means variance, a plot showing the row-to-row mean vs. variance of differences between a pair of flats is created. This plot shows different amplifiers in different colors, and allows for identification of outliers of row-wise correlated noise for individual amplifiers (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:rowMeansVar}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/row_means_variance_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{Row means variance plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:rowMeansVar}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Charge-transfer inefficiency}

Plots showing the dependence of charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) on signal are also generated. Different amplifiers are plotted in different colors. Plots are generated for both serial and parallel CTI; Figure~\ref{fig:ref:scti}) shows an example serial CTI plot.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/scti_vs_flux_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_cti_vs_flux_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020455Z.png}
    \caption{Serial CTI plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:scti}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\paragraph{BF covariances}

From the flat pair acquisitions, plots measuring the brighter-fatter covariance as a function of flux are generated. Amplifiers are plotted in different colors so that outliers can easily be traced to their respective sensors (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:bfCov}). 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/bf_covariance_plots_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_bf_analysis_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131510Z.png}
    \caption{Brighter-fatter covariance plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:bfCov}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Persistence}

B protocol runs include a persistence acquisition, which is a saturated flat (usually at 400k\,e-/pixel), followed by a sequence of multiple 15\,s dark images. From analysis of this image acquisition sequence, persistence plots are generated that show the decay of residual signal in the dark sequence. These plots are color coded according to amplifier (Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:persistence}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/persistence_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_persistence_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020526Z.png}
    \caption{Persistence plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.  Units are ADU.}

\section{OCS integration}
A secondary goal of the run 7 campaign is further testing of integration between the Camera Control System (CCS) and the Observatory Control System (OCS). The tests performed with OCS control of LSSTCam during this campaign are the first operations of the LSSTCam with OCS which will be the normal operating mode during operations of the Simonyi Survey Telescope. To this end, many tests were performed during the Run 7 campaign including basic functionality tests, short OpSim runs, long, scheduler-driven OpSim runs ("survey mode") and the start of mock calibrations.

\subsection{LSSTCam in OCS}
\subsubsection{Configurable SAL Components (CSC) - base unit of OCS}

Every component controlled by the OCS is represented by a CSC. CSCs are remote objects capable of receiving command and publishing telemetry and events. During the run 7 campaign, CSC communicated with DDS middleware, which was replaced by Kafka middleware in early 2025. Most CSCs interact with lower level software such as an engineering interface, pipelines, or in the case of all cameras (LSSTCam, ComCam and LATISS) the ocs-bridge component of CCS.

LSSTCam is represented by a a group of 3 CSCs:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MTCamera: this is the ocs-bridge in CCS as seen by the OCS - not exactly a CSC in the traditional sense, but will often be called a CSC. ocs-bridge communicates over DDS/Kafka middleware just as any CSC would.
    \item MTOODS: Main Telescope Observatory Operations Data Service - handles data ingestion to LSST butler and purging old data from disks once ingested.
    \item MTHeaderService: manages fits header data for images (science program, scheduler config, weather data and more)
\end{enumerate}

These can all be seen on LOVE, LSST Observatory Visualization Environment, ASummaryState view under the LSSTCam group of CSCs in figure \ref{fig:app:lsstcamcsc}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/appendixFigs/lsstcamcsc.png}
    \caption{LSSTCam CSCs in LOVE.}
    \label{fig:app:lsstcamcsc}
\end{figure}

CSCs in general have 4 regular operation states and 2 other states with the general rules. Normal states:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item STANDBY (transitions only to DISABLED): software is running on OCS computing clusters, but is not doing anything.
    \item DISABLED (Transitions to STANDBY, ENABLED, FAULT): Software is running and communicating with hardware. Telemetry is sent to the EFD.
    \item ENABLED (Transitions to DISABLED, FAULT): Software is running and ready to receive commands.
    \item FAULT (transitions only to STANDBY): Software encountered a critical issue. Watcher alarms will be activated.
\end{enumerate}
Extra states:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item OFFLINE: The software is not available and active within the OCS computing clusters. 
    \item UNKNOWN: The software is not deployed within the OCS computing clusters. 
\end{enumerate}

However, MTCamera, ATCamera and CCCamera are not exactly CSCs, but rather the OCS-bridge. OCS-bridge maintains all states, but practically only has different behavior for 3 of them: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item OFFLINE: OCS-bridge is not being used by the OCS. This is the state it should be in when controlling a camera through lower level CCS commands.
    \item STANDBY: OCS-bridge has control of camera systems. The OCS itself cannot issue commands to the camera in this state however. This is a “safe mode” during the day / end of night.
    \item ENABLED: OCS-bridge has control of camera systems. The OCS can issues commands the Camera. The camera can be controlled through scripts and the scheduler. This is the state when the camera is in use for calibrations and operations.
\end{enumerate}
Telemetry is always sent to the EFD from CCS.

\subsubsection{ts\_xml}
The both the software interface definitions and official ICD of T\&S/OCS systems are handled by ts\_xml. The human readable ICD version of ts\_xml may be found here: . The github management of these files (+ machine readable versions) are found here: 

 . 

As the camera and ocs-bridge interface with OCS, the CCS team generates an xml file that defines all commands, events and telemetry that the OCS knows about from the ocs-bridge for each CCS release. This can be found under MTCamera (also ATCamera and CCCamera for the other cameras) here (human-readable): 
  and here (machine-readable):  

\subsubsection{OCS Scheduler and Script Queue}
OCS is operated via python scripts, which can be seen in these repositories: Standard Scripts and External Scripts. Standard scripts undergo rigorous testing to ensure functionality across all versions. These form the basic functions of the observatory. External scripts have less rigorous testing and are not guaranteed to work across versions. These are for specific, sometimes one-off tests of observatory systems.

Scripts to be executed are added to a script queue for the observatory. At the time of writing, 3 script queues are available: AuxTel, MainTel and OCS. AuxTel and MainTel are for operating their respective telescopes, the OCS queue is a backup queue for other operations, for example, LSSTCam EO testing.

Aside from manual addition scripts to the queue, each script queue has an associated scheduler which may add scripts to the queue through predefined scripts (JSON blocks) or programatically with the Rubin Scheduler taking input data such as time of day, weather, feasibility and more based on a scheduler configuration. Configurations and JSON blocks may be found under the Scheduler section of ts\_config\_ocs.

Both the script queues and their respective schedulers are represented through CSCs. SAL index 1 corresponds to MainTel, 2 corresponds to AuxTel and 3 corresponds to OCS.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/appendixFigs/schedulerscriptqueue.png}
    \caption{Visualization of scripts queues and schedulers in LOVE.}
    \label{fig:app:schedulerscriptqueue.png}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{OCS-Bridge}
ocs-bridge is a CCS sub-component that communicates with the OCS. Instead of being a standard CSC, it has its own interface to the observatory via DDS (soon to be kaftka) middleware. It issues commands to the camera via MCM. It also raises events upon command/activity completion. These events are used by the OCS/scripts to determine when to stop waiting for an action to complete.

An example procedure for taking control of the camera with OCS / ocs-bridge can be viewed in this test case: BLOCK-T154

ocs-bridge must be in offline-available to allow the OCS to take control. This is done with ocs-bridge setAvailable with a lock on ocs-bridge in a ccs-shell. For OCS to successfully bring MTCamera to enabled (ocs-bridge in ENABLED state) MCM must able to transition its controlled subsystems to normal mode. This requires a few conditions, some are listed here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MCM must be able to enter normal mode
    \item Shutter must be closed
    \item Alarms on subsystems such as focal-plane must be cleared
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing steps and achievements in Run 7}
OCS testing with LSSTCam was part of three steps of the Run 7 campaign. Prior to starting any of the steps, basic functionality was confirmed with single exposures via an OCS script. The first image taken with OCS happened on September 13th, 2024 early in the campaign to give time to address potential issues. The 3 steps with OCS driven operation where then as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 30 minute OpSim runs. These were pre-generated sequences pulled from survey simulations including filter changes and different observation strategies for different filters, which may be a feature of the LSST survey. Two runs were successfully completed: E1414 which included operation of the shutter and E1585 which did not operate the shutter.
    \item Fully scheduler driven OpSim runs. These runs used the Rubin Scheduler to dynamically choose targets, filter changes and exposure times depending on the filter. The scheduler was configured to choose targets at any time - not only with the sun down - and to only operate LSSTCam and not point the telescope, though simulated slew times were added. 
    \item A run of an example calibration sequence that could be run as part of a daily calibration sequence. This was intended to include testing image ingestion and processing of the calibrations with the observatory control system.
\end{itemize}

Together, these steps demonstrated the ability to operate LSSTCam in a mode similar to what night time operations are anticipated to be like in a steady state. The listed acquisitions include over 12 hours of operation under control of the OCS including filter changes, shutter operation, guider ROI setting and variable exposure times. These operations also included simulated slew times. Image acquisition also worked in conjunction with the observatory header service to populate image headers with additional details and telemetry from the observatory.

While testing was largely successful, some issues were encountered and resolved along the way. One issue was that the interface for sending guider regions of interest (ROIs) through the OCS was incomplete. The initial interface was developed and tested as part of this process. The sending of guider ROIs revealed another issue with command acknowledgments between the camera OCS bridge and the scripts operating the system.  


\subsection{Further testing and development}
Not all testing goals to verify the Camera-OCS interface were possible during Run 7. A future testing period for lingering items is planned in February or March, 2025 to close the loop on the remaining tests. These tests will use playlists and playback of data taken during Run 7.

An item to test is the summit storage facility for operations (S3), which was not yet available. With the playback mode testing, we will verify proper ingestion of images into S3.

Another open item to be tested is a complete loop of calibrations being processed with the Observatory Control Pipeline Service (OCPS) immediately after their acquisition. A calibration playlist is included as part of the planned OCS testing period. With this data can be collected and sent to the OCPS to verify near real time processing of calibrations.

Lastly, between Run 7 and the first photon of LSSTCam, the observatory changed the communication middleware software used within the OCS. The change from DDS to Kafka is expected to improve stability of the communication between distributed software components of the OCS. For LSSTCam, the playback testing will be used to test if both general performance in the new middleware environment, and to see if missing command acknowledgments found in Run 7 remain reproducible.

\section{Phosphorescence}\label{appendix:phosphorescence}
Because we have discovered the phosphorescence in ITL sensors only recently, we have here cobbled together the data products described here. We believe they are appropriate for quantitative characterization of these systematics that are essentially a position dependent hysteresis indexed by recent illumination history. 

Happily, the {\it front side persistence} seen in e2v sensors has been strongly suppressed with only parallel clock swing voltage adjustment ({\it cf.} Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:persistence} for post-mitigation performance). Although the working assumption of the {\it e2v persistence} was that it affected all pixels identically, this has not been demonstrated, and only sensor-averaged {\it persistence} expression were evaluated to date. The current, post-mitigation {\it persistence} performance ({\it cf.} Fig~\ref{fig:finalChar-persistenceAllLEDs}) provide indirect evidence of the spatial dependence to the {\it persistence}, revealed in the {\it skew} of the distributions quantified:\footnote{NB. It is still difficult to disentangle true {\it persistence} from residual charge read out following {\it clear} operations with finite inefficiency. However, it is believed that operating with {\bf NopSf} removes nearly all residual signal resulting from incomplete clear.} Especially with {\it y-band} illumination, the significant skew apparently indicates pixel-to-pixel variation in persistence, which has not yet received adequate attention as a mechanism that would fall within ISR scope.

The {\it phosphorescence} seen in ITL sensors is highly position dependent as compared to the {\it front side persistence}. This was first revealed plainly in the morphology of post-illumination dark images of R43\_S11 ({\it cf.} Fig.~\ref{subfig:hvb_on_R43_S11}) and R00\_SW1 ({\it cf.} Fig.~\ref{fig:phos:stains}). Clearly, the methodology of {\it persistence} estimation feedback, used while tuning clock swing, is not suitable for quantifying {\it phosphorescence} in parts of the focal plane covered by ITL sensors.

The data products displayed in the following sections are described here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\ast$] Identification phosphorescent regions (Appendix \ref{appendix:phos:ident}): Using the 20 B-protocol runs containing the {\it BOT PERSISTENCE} set of images, we constructed pixel-by-pixel median images over the 20 instances of the {\it first} post-flash {\bf dark} image, and also for the {\it twentieth} post-flash {\bf dark} image. The difference between the two ({\it first} minus {\it twentieth}) is 8x8 blocked and displayed on a raft-by-raft basis. Such pixels appear significant when they contain (on average) 10e$^-$ of transient signal within the first 15s dark.
    \item[$\ast$] Comparison against {\it blue} flat field response (Appendix \ref{appendix:phos:coffeestains}): The same {\it transient term} images described above are displayed {\it without} blocking, no rebinning. These were inspected alongside the {\it blue} flat field response images to estimate whether {\it coffee stain} and {\it vampire pixel} features are consistently correlated with phosphorescent regions. (No for {\it coffee stains}, yes for {\it vampire pixels}.)
    \item[$\ast$] Kinetics characterization (Appendix \ref{appendix:phos:kinetics}): Pixel-by-pixel median images constructed with the 20 {\it BOT PERSISTENCE} datasets were constructed for each of the 20 successive dark images following the flash (trigger) exposure. These data products did not subtract the twentieth median image from each, but were kept intact. Using ROI pixel extractions and signal level quantile estimations, we extract high significance evolution of the transient signal, with the understanding that different pixels may be driving each time slice's quantile level. In principle, this could be repeated for each pixel in the focal plane to generate a short list of parameters modeled after the function given in Fig.~\ref{fig:phos:kinetics:fit:R20S20C13}\footnote{These results are expected to be sensitive to details of the {\it trigger} exposure and where it is placed temporally within the exposure duration. We currently do not have such transient functions measured after illumination exposure defined by the Camera Shutter's {\it open} duration.}. Evolution of the actual cumulative distributions for a selection of ROIs are provided.
    \item[$\ast$] Response characterization (Appendix \ref{appendix:phos:response}): The acquired data available to address phosphorescence response to illumination (wavelength and signal level in the trigger as independent variables) were marginally adequate to estimate the {\it amplitude only} of a putative decay profile resembling Fig.~\ref{fig:phos:kinetics:fit:R20S20C13}. We did not have 20 {\it BOT PERSISTENCE} datasets from which to construct median images, and so worked only with the single instances available (specifically, only the first dark image following flash). Variations from ROI to ROI in the phosphorescence response are clearly seen across the independent variable plane (illumination wavelength and signal level)\footnote{Note that ROI extractions from single dark images such as these are susceptible to cosmic rays. The 99\% quantile level applied to the extraction also gets pegged to the noise distribution at about $3\sigma$ when the product of phosphorescent response and trigger illumination level is small.}.
