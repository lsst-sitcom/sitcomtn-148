\subsubsection{Focal-plane measurement figures}

One of two common plots from sections \ref{reverification} and \ref{finalCharacterization} is a focal-plane measurement plot, showing eo-pipe measurements in different runs. These plots are constructed to show measurements arranged localized to the LSSTCam focal plane orientation. Different sensors are plotted in different colors, with one point plotted for each amplifier on each sensor. The plots are arranged such that an apples-to-apples comparison is made between two different runs (see figure \ref{fig:ref:eoPipeFP_5x5}). On one axis is the measurements from one run, while the other axis has the measurements from a different run. If the measurements are consistent, the points should fall along the identity line. Deviations from measurements on the identity line indicate that one run is measuring the quantity at a higher or lower value than the other run. This plot is useful for identifying localized deviations between different runs, and also e2v and ITL specific behavior.

\subsubsection{Differential histograms}

Another common plot from sections \ref{reverification} and \ref{finalCharacterization} is a histogram, where the counts in histogram bins are differences of amplifier measurements for a given quantity. These histograms are commonly separated by detector type, to show any detector-dependent response. For a consistent measurement, these histograms should be Gaussian centered around zero, with no bias in one direction or another. Distributions that are not centered around zero indicate a change in the measurement between different runs.

\subsection{Web report reference figures}

A common tool for rapidly reviewing LSSTCam EO data are \href{https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/data/rubin/lsstcam/}{web reports}, which provide full focal-plane, raft level, and sensor level figures of reference for prompt analysis of data runs. Web reports from runs 6 and 7 are available.

\subsubsection{Focal-plane level}
% \paragraph{Focal-plane layout}

\paragraph{Focal-plane mosaics for different quantities}

Focal plane mosaics consist of fully assembled focal planes, with amplifiers colored according to the associated measurement. The full focal-plane mosaics are generated for most eo-pipe parameters and are scaled appropriately for each parameter. These plots provide a visualization that shows differences in e2v and ITL sensors across the focal plane, and the uniformity.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/ptc_gain_plot_LSSTCam_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{A focal plane mosaic from run E1881 for PTC gain}
    \label{fig:ref:fpMosaic}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Histograms}

In addition to focal-plane mosaics, histograms are created for all eo-pipe metrics. These histograms have bins and ranges specific to each parameter. For some parameters, the histograms provide a neat visualization to quantify differences in e2v and ITL measurements, such as figure \ref{fig:ref:histogram} for PTC $a_{00}$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/ptc_a00_hist_LSSTCam_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{A histogram from run E1881 for PTC $a_{00}$}
    \label{fig:ref:histogram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Raft level}

\paragraph{Correlation figures}

Correlation figures are created on the raft level for all science rafts. Two types of correlation figures are created; one for the imaging region, and one for the overscan region. The correlation computed is a Pearson correlation coefficient.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/overscan_correlation_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_raft_amp_correlations_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T015955Z.png}
    \caption{Overscan correlations for R22\_S11 in run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:overscanCorrelations}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Lambda mosaics}

As a part of the standard B protocol, flats are taken in different LEDs to provide a chromatic response across the bandpass relevant to LSST. The mosaic is assembled on the raft level, and short wavelength flats show the laser annealing pattern characteristic to e2v sensors (see figure \ref{fig:ref:blueLambda}).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/eoRaftMosaic_LSSTCam_blue_MC_C_20241030_000276_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_raft_lambda_mosaics_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020341Z.png}
    \caption{Blue led mosaic for R22 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:blueLambda}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Calibration frames}

For runs with bias dark and flat frames (most commonly B protocols), combined calibrations are produced and assembled on the raft level. These mosaics are gain corrected.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/eoDarkRaftMosaic_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_raft_calib_mosaics_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020324Z.png}
    \caption{Calibration dark for R22 from run E1880, extracted using B protocol dark sequence.}
    \label{fig:ref:calibFrame}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Bias stability}

Bias stability figures are created for acquisition sequences that acquire multiple bias frames. Three different bias stability plots are created; amp-wise mean vs time, amp-wise standard deviation vs time, amp-wise mean vs time for region covering the readout corner.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/bias_rc_mean_vs_time_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_bias_stability_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020021Z.png}
    \caption{Bias stability mean vs time in readout corner for R22 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:biasStability}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Divisadero profiles}

Divisadero tearing profiles are created for each raft, with divisadero response grouped along the mid-line break. The regions of individual amplifiers are marked by dashed lines to show regions where divisadero response is expected.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/divisadero_raft_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S00_u_lsstccs_eo_divisadero_tearing_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020421Z.png}
    \caption{Divisadero tearing profile for R22 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:divisaderoProfile}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Sensor level}

\paragraph{Bias profiles}

Bias profiles are created for each sensor, along both serial and parallel directions. Amplifiers are plotted separately to allow for amplifier dependent response to be identified. Different columns/rows are plotted in different colors to allow for identification of problematic columns/rows.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/bias_parallel_profile_plots_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_bias_stability_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020021Z.png}
    \caption{Median bias profile in the parallel direction for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:biasProfile}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{PTCs}

PTC plots are created for each sensor, and separated by amplifier. For each amplifier, a PTC curve is created. PTC gain, $a_{00}$, and PTC turnoff (in ADU) is shown for each amplifier. The red points in PTC curves (figure \ref{fig:ref:PTCs}) denote all measurements before PTC turnoff.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/ptc_plots_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{PTC plots for R22\_S11 from run E1881.}
    \label{fig:ref:PTCs}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\paragraph{Nonlinearity}

Linearity plots are created for each sensor, and separated by amplifier. For each amplifier, a linearity curve is created showing photodiode current integral vs. e-/pixel for all flat pairs. Maximum fractional deviation, maximum observed signal, and linearity turnoff (in ADU) is shown for each amplifier. The red points in the linearity curves (figure \ref{fig:ref:linearity}) denote all measurements between 100 e-/pixel and linearity turnoff.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/linearity_fit_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_linearity_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131453Z.png}
    \caption{Linearity plots for R22\_S11 from run E1881.}
    \label{fig:ref:linearity}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
Plots for linearity residuals are also generated, showing the fractional residuals for each amplifier as a function of the photodiode current integral.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/linearity_residuals_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_linearity_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131453Z.png}
    \caption{Linearity residual plots for R22\_S11 from run E1881.}
    \label{fig:ref:linearityResids}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Data from flat pairs}

To support studies of row-means variance, a plot showing the row-to-row mean vs. variance of differences between a pair of flats is created. This plot shows different amplifiers in different colors, and allows for identification of changes in correlated noise along with row for individual amplifiers.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/row_means_variance_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_ptc_plots_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131208Z.png}
    \caption{Row means variance plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:rowMeansVar}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\paragraph{CTI}

Plots for showing the charge transfer inefficiency as a function of signal. Different amplifiers are plotted in different colors. CTI plots are generated for serial and parallel CTI.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/scti_vs_flux_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_cti_vs_flux_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020455Z.png}
    \caption{Serial CTI plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:scti}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\paragraph{BF covariances}

To complement flat pair acquisitions, plots measuring the brighter fatter covariance as a function of flux are generated. Amplifiers are plotted in different colors to easily identify outliers on individual sensors. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/bf_covariance_plots_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_bf_analysis_E1881_w_2024_35_20241105T131510Z.png}
    \caption{Brighter-fatter covariance plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}
    \label{fig:ref:bfCov}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Persistence}

B protocols include a persistence acquisition, which is a saturated flat (usually at 400k e-), followed by a sequence of multiple 15 sec dark images. To complement this image acquisition, persistence plots are generated that show the decay of residual signal in the dark sequence. These plots are in units of ADU, and are color coded according to each amplifier.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/ReferenceFigures/persistence_plot_LSSTCam_R22_S11_u_lsstccs_eo_persistence_E1880_w_2024_35_20241101T020526Z.png}
    \caption{Persistence plot for R22\_S11 from run E1880.}

\section{Phosphorescence}\label{appendix:phosphorescence}
Because we have discovered the phosphorescence in ITL sensors only recently, we have here cobbled together the following data products. We believe they are appropriate for quantitative characterization of the systematics. Happily, the {\it persistence} seen in e2v sensors has been strongly suppressed with only parallel clock swing voltage adjustment ({\it cf.} Fig.~\ref{fig:ref:persistence} for post-mitigation performance). Although the working assumption of the {\it e2v persistence} was that it affected all pixels identically, this has not been demonstrated, and only sensor-averaged {\it persistence} expression were evaluated until recently. The current {\it persistence} mitigation performance ({\it cf.} Fig~\ref{fig:finalChar-persistenceAllLEDs}) provide indirect evidence of the spatial dependence to the {\it persistence}, revealed in the {\it skew} of the distributions quantified:\footnote{NB. It is still difficult to disentangle true {\it persistence} from residual charge read out following {\it clear} operations with finite inefficiency. However, it is believed that operating with {\bf NopSf} removes nearly all residual signal resulting from incomplete clear.} Especially with {\it y-band} illumination, the significant skew apparently indicates significant pixel-to-pixel variation in persistence, which hasn't yet received adequate attention as a mechanism that would fall within ISR scope.

The {\it phosphorescence} seen in ITL sensors is also highly position dependent. This was first revealed plainly in the morphology of post-illumination dark images of R43\_S11 ({\it cf.} Fig.~\ref{subfig:hvb_on_R43_S11}) and R00\_SW1 ({\it cf.} Fig.~\ref{fig:phos:stains}). Clearly, the methodology of {\it persistence} estimation feedback, used while tuning clock swing, is not suitable for quantifying {\it phosphorescence} in the ITL set of sensors.
